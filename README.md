Adaptive Quadrature for Numerical Integration
============================================

- I implemented four adaptive methods based on trapezoid, Simpson, Left-Interval, Right-Interval rules. 
- The implimetation applies recursive programming. The program also outputs the subdivisions given maximum relative error and maximum number of subdivision allowed.
